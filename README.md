# Metro Interstate Traffic Data Cleaning

In this project, I attempted to cleanse and transform a traffic volume data spanning from late 2012 to mid 2018.
The goal is to make it fit for the linear regression analysis, especially using the holidays as dummy variables.

**Data Source**: [Metro Interstate Traffic Volume, UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/492/metro+interstate+traffic+volume])
